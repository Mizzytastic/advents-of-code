# Advents of Code

A personal project doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about), starting at 2015 and working through each year, with the aim of doing each year in a different language. The goal is to practice my problem solving, learn some new languages, remember some old ones and most of all have fun.

## Years

- **[2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015)**: Python
- **2016 and onwards**: TBD
